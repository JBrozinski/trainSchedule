The Train Schedule displays the destination, time of initial departure, frequency of departures and minutes remaining until next departure, for all scheduled trains. 
To set up your own train schedule, fill in the form on the lower half of the page. Include the name of your train, the destination, initial departure and frequency with which the train will depart. Your information, including minutes remaining until the next departure, will be added to the schedule.
